I have used a third-party backend for this app. 

1. Clone the backend repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/lakshay8000/CRMAppBackend.git .
2. Navigate to the Repository
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the server by using the command- npm start.


## Installation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create .env file and set up the Base URL and API timeout for backend requests in it.
4. Start the development server locally using `npm run dev` (built with Vite).
